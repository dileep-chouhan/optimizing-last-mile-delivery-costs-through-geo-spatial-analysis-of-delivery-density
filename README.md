# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs through Geo-Spatial Analysis of Delivery Density

## Overview

This project analyzes delivery data to identify geographically concentrated delivery zones and proposes optimized routing strategies to reduce last-mile delivery expenses.  The analysis leverages geo-spatial techniques to pinpoint areas of high delivery density and subsequently suggests adjustments to routing protocols aimed at achieving a 15% reduction in last-mile delivery costs within the next quarter.  The project utilizes data visualization to clearly illustrate key findings and proposed optimizations.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries as needed, e.g., Geopandas, Scikit-learn]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You may need to adjust file paths within `main.py` to point to your own data files.  The project assumes the existence of a properly formatted CSV file containing delivery data (see `data/sample_delivery_data.csv` for an example format).

## Example Output

The script will print key analytical findings to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of delivery density across different geographical zones.
* Identification of high-density zones requiring optimized routing.
* Estimated cost savings based on proposed routing optimizations.

Additionally, the script generates the following visualization files in the `output` directory:

* `delivery_density_map.png`: A map visualizing delivery density across the geographical area.
* `optimized_routes.png`: A visualization of the proposed optimized delivery routes (if applicable).  [Add other output files as needed]


## Data

The project includes sample data in `data/sample_delivery_data.csv`.  This file should be replaced with your own delivery data.  The expected format includes at least latitude, longitude, and potentially other relevant attributes like delivery date and time.
